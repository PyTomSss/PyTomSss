# Welcome to my profile !

## About Me 
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at ENSAE (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) as part of a double diploma with HEC Paris, while simultaneously completing a Research Master's in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning (MVA) at ENS Paris-Saclay.

My focus this year has been on Computational Statistics, Data Science and Machine Learning. I have found the theoretical exploration of these topics highly engaging, and I am now keen to apply this knowledge through practical projects.
