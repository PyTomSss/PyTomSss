## About Me 
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at ENSAE (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) and enrolled in a double diploma with HEC Paris. 

My focus this year has been on Data Science and Machine Learning. I have found the theoretical exploration of these topics highly engaging, and I am now keen to apply this knowledge through practical projects, particularly those with applications in economics.
