# **Welcome to my Profile !**

## About Me 

I am currently a **first-year PhD student** at the **University of Oxford**, within the **EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training - StatML** ([StatML Cohort 2025](https://statml.io)), under the supervision of **Prof. Tom Rainforth**.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Bayesian Experimental Design**, **Bayesian Decision Theory**, and **Statistical Machine Learning**. Broadly, my work focuses on one of the central open questions in modern machine learning:  
> *How can we design principled data acquisition solutions to improve learning efficiency and generalization?*

- Developed *robust learning methods* for modeling the *mechanical market impact* in *limit order books*, combining the paradigms of **Learning Using Privileged Information** and **Distributionally Robust Optimization**.  
---

### **Imperial College London** ‚Äì *Department of Mathematics*  
**Supervisor:** Prof. O. Deniz Akyildiz  

**Project:** *Interacting Langevin Diffusions and Their Applications in Bayesian Statistics*  
- Designed a **novel algorithm based on Annealed Langevin Dynamics** to improve sampling efficiency and convergence in Bayesian inference.  
- Applied the method to *latent variable models* and *Maximum Marginal Likelihood Estimation (MMLE)* problems.  
- Conducted comprehensive numerical experiments in Python, demonstrating significant *performance gains over classical methods*.
